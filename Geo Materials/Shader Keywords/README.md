# Info
- Here is where I will list information regarding what I figure out about shader keywords as I mess around with them over time.
- I will list keywords found inside Chroma here.
  *For a larger, more-likely-to-not-work list, go [here](Unverified%20Keywords/README.md).
- I will be listing these keywords under the shader I believe it will work for.
- The shader names I will use are the ones listed in Unity that get put on geo, not the shader names from Chroma as I suspect the one listed by Unity is the important one.

### Stuff to keep in mind
- I know nothing about materials, shaders, and shader keywords.
- I know VERY little about Unity.
- I got these keywords from 
- I have not tested every keyword listed here.

### Shader List
Here I will have a list of what shader each Chroma shader uses:
- Standard = SimpleLit
- OpaqueLight = OpaqueNeonLight
- TransparentLight = TransparentNeonLight
- BaseWater = WaterLit
- BillieWater = WaterLit
- BTSPillar = SimpleLit
- InterscopeConcrete = SimpleLit
- InterscopeCar = SimpleLit
- WaterfallMirror = Mirror

# Keywords provided by Chroma 
- [SimpleLit](README.md#SimpleLit)
- [OpaqueNeonLight](README.md#OpaqueNeonLight)
- [TransparentNeonLight](README.md#TransparentNeonLight)
- [WaterLit](README.md#WaterLit)
- [Mirror](README.md#Mirror)
