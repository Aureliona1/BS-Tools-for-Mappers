# Info
- Here is where I will list information regarding what I figure out about shader keywords as I mess around with them over time.
- I will list keywords found inside Chroma on this page. (For a larger, more-likely-to-not-work list, go [here](Unverified%20Keywords/README.md))
- The shader names I will use are the ones listed in Unity that get put on geo, not the shader names from Chroma as I suspect the one listed by Unity is the important one.

### Stuff to keep in mind
- I have not tested every keyword listed here.
- Some keywords were added in later versions of the game.

### Shader List
Here is a list of what shader each Chroma shader uses:
- Standard = SimpleLit
- OpaqueLight = OpaqueNeonLight
- TransparentLight = TransparentNeonLight
- BaseWater = WaterLit
- BillieWater = WaterLit
- BTSPillar = SimpleLit
- InterscopeConcrete = SimpleLit
- InterscopeCar = SimpleLit
- WaterfallMirror = Mirror

# Keywords provided by Chroma 
- [SimpleLit](README.md#SimpleLit)
- [OpaqueNeonLight](README.md#OpaqueNeonLight)
- [TransparentNeonLight](README.md#TransparentNeonLight)
- [WaterLit](README.md#WaterLit)
