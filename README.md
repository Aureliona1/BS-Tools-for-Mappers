# Info

### Welcome
- Everything here is free to use, just don't claim anything as your own if it isn't.
- Feel free to modify anything however you want and use it however you want.
- You don't have to credit me if you use anything but you can if you want, I like seeing my username.

### Details
- Currently, everything will be made for [Swifter's Remapper TypeScript library](https://github.com/Swifter1243/ReMapper) unless specified otherwise.
  * As of now, I will be using Remapper 3.1.1 because I couldn't get anything newer to work and I don't feel like fixing it.
  * If you need anything here in a different format that is not provided: Converting stuff to JSON is easy, and I don't know the JavaScript way of doing things, but I'm sure you could figure it out, I believe in you :)
- I have tested everything mentioned here exclusively on the 1.27 Oculus PC version of the game, running Noodle 1.5.5, Heck 1.4.6, and Chroma 2.7.2.
  * So, *__compatibility with any other configuration is not guaranteed.__*

### Other important stuff
- Please do not ask me questions about how to use these things if you don't know, this is not a support page. 
  * However, if something doesn't work as expected and it's my fault, please let me know.
- I've never used Github before so excuse the jank.
  * If you have any suggestions or feedback you can contact me on Discord. (@shonshyn_)
- Huge thanks to Nasafrasa for teaching me how to use Remapper and other stuff.
