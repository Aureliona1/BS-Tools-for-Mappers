Everything here is free to use, just don't claim anything as your own if it isn't. 
Feel free to modify anything however you want and use it however you want. 
You don't have to credit me if you use anything but credit would be very much appreciated, I like seeing my username. 
Everything will be made for Swifter's Remapper thingy. (https://github.com/Swifter1243/ReMapper)
As of now, I will be using Remapper 3.1.1 because I couldn't get anything newer to work and I don't feel like fixing it.
Converting stuff to JSON is easy, and I don't know the javascript way of doing things, but I'm sure you could figure it out if you need it in those formats. :)
Do not ask me questions about how to use these things if you don't know, this is not a support page. 
However, if something doesn't work as expected and it's my fault, please let me know.
I've never used Github before so excuse the jank. 
If you have any suggestions or feedback you can contact me on Discord. (@shonshyn_)
